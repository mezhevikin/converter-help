## How to disable ads? [ios]

To disable ads you can buy Premium only for `5$ per year`.

☕️ Annual subscription for the price of a cup of coffee.

1.  Open app.
2.  Tap `(:)` button.
3.  Tap `Settings`.
4.  Tap `Premium`.
5.  Tap `Buy`.
6.  Confirm purchase.
7.  Enjoy the app. 🎉

🙏 Thanks for your input. Money from ads and subscriptions goes towards developing the app and paying for servers.

<a name="disable-ads-android"></a>
## How to disable ads? [android]

Unfortunately, you can't disable ads now because Google Play has disabled monetization for all Russian developers due to sanctions.

Until March 2022, the app had the ability to disable ads for only `$5 per year`.

✉️ [Send me email](mailto:mezhevikin@gmail.com?subject=DisableAdsAndroid) to be notified when the issue is resolved.

<a name="hate-ads"></a>
## I hate fullscreen ads!

I don't like full screen ads either. But unfortunately, it's the only type of advertising that makes money.

The small banner at the bottom of the app doesn't make any money because advertisers aren't interested in this format.

Money from ads goes towards developing the app and paying for servers. Thanks for your input. 🙏

⛔️ If you see bad ads:

1.  Tap button `(i)` in the corner of the banner.
2.  Tap `Send feedback`.
3.  Tap `Ad was inappropriate`.

<a name="source-rates"></a>
## Where does app get exchange rates from?

The app gets the exchange rates from our server.

Our server, in turn, gets the data from 20 sources and calculates the middle market rate.

`0.915, 0.917, 0.919, 0.919, 0.919, 0.921, 0.921`

For example, if sources show these exchange rates for `USD-EUR`, then the middle market rate will be `0.919`.

<a name="wrong-rates"></a>
## Exchange rates are wrong

The app gets exchange rates from 20 sources and calculate the middle market rates.

The exchange rate at your currency exchange place may be different because they may have additional fees.

<a name="own-rates"></a>
## How to set my own exchange rates?

To set own rate:

1.  Tap `(:)` button.
2.  Tap `Own rate`.
3.  Enter number.
4.  Tap `Set`.

To remove own rate:

1.  Tap `(:)` button.
2.  Tap `Own rate`.
3.  Tap `Remove`.

The ability to set your own rate is available starting from version `3.0`.

<a name="update-rates"></a>
## How often does app update exchange rates?

The app updates the exchange rates once per hour.

The application can work without internet using the latest downloaded data.

<a name="offline"></a>
## Can I use app without internet?

Yes, the app has an offline mode and fully works without internet. It is very convenient for traveling.

Wherein, when internet is available, the app updates the exchange rates once per hour.

<a name="no-currency"></a>
## Why is there no XXX currency?

The app has all the currencies of the world from [this list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_circulating_currencies), and also the top 20 cryptocurrencies according to [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) rating.

I do not include cryptocurrencies that are connected to the US dollar, like USDT, USDC, BUSD, etc.

<a name="sort-currencies"></a>
## How to sort currencies in list?

Currencies are sorted by how often you use them. The more you convert a currency, the higher it will be in the list.

You cannot change the order manually.

<a name="change-widget"></a>
## How to change currencies in widget? [ios]

The widget shows the three currencies that you most often use in the converter in relation to the currency of your country selected in the iOS settings.

To change your country, open `iOS Settings` → `General` → `Language & Region` → `Region` -> Select country.

At the moment, you can't select the currencies yourself, but I'm developing a standalone application called `Exchange Rates Widget` with the ability to select currencies and customize the design..

👀 You can find out about the release of the application on this page or on my twitter [@mezhevikin\_alex](https://twitter.com/mezhevikin_alex).

<a name="more-currencies"></a>
## How to add more currencies to main screen?

You cannot add more than two currencies to the main screen.

I don't want to change the design of the app and break the habit of 7 million users.

However, I am working on a new app with a different design and with 5 currencies on the main screen.

👀 You can find out about the release of the application on this page or on my twitter [@mezhevikin\_alex](https://twitter.com/mezhevikin_alex).

<a name="swap"></a>
## How to swap currencies and values?

To swap only the currencies, tap `↑↓` button.

To swap the currencies and values, tap `(:)` button and select `Swap all`.

The `Swap all` function is available since version 3.0

<a name="restore-premium"></a>
## I bought premium but I see ads [ios]

If you have reinstalled the app or bought a new device, you need to restore your Premium. This does not require any additional payment.

1.  Open app.
2.  Tap `(:)` button.
3.  Tap `Settings`.
4.  Tap `Premium`.
5.  Tap `Restore`.

If the restore did not help, you need to check that the subscription is active.

1.  Open `Settings` on iOS.
2.  Tap `your name` on the top.
3.  Tap `Subscriptions`.
4.  Tap `Converter`.
5.  Check expiry date.

If you do not see the Converter in the list or the subscription date has expired, then you have a payment problem.

In this case you should write to [AppStore support](https://support.apple.com/billing). Developers do not have direct access to acquiring. Therefore, only Apple can solve this issue.

<a name="cancel-premium"></a>
## How to cancel premium subscription? [ios]

1.  Open `Settings` on iOS.
2.  Tap `your name` on the top.
3.  Tap `Subscriptions`.
4.  Tap `Converter`.
5.  Tap `Cancel Subscription`.

You might need to scroll down to find the `Cancel Subscription` button. If there is no Cancel button or you see an expiration message in red text, the subscription is already canceled.

<a name="why-subscription"></a>
## I don't like subscriptions, I want one-time purchase [ios]

I known that users don't like subscriptions, but unfortunately a one-time purchase is not suitable in this case, because my app has daily expenses.

1.  The app is used by 500,000 users every day, and I need a powerful server to handle all of the traffic.
2.  The app uses a distributed DNS network to ensure that exchange rates load quickly from anywhere in the world.
3.  The app aggregates exchange rates from 20 sources, some of which are paid.

Subscriptions and ads allow me to focus on developing an amazing product and not worry about how I will pay the bills tomorrow.

<a name="premium-russia"></a>
## How to pay for a premium subscription in Russia? [ios]

Starting from March 2022 AppStore does not accept payments from Russian banks.

But you can pay for purchases using the balance of `MTS` and `Beeline`.

1.  Open `Settings` on iOS.
2.  Tap `your name` on the top.
3.  Tap `Payment & Shipping`.
4.  Tap `Add Payment Method`.
5.  Tap `Mobile phone`.
6.  Enter your phone number.
7.  Enter sms code.
8.  Tap `Edit` button.
9.  Move item `Mobile phone` to the top of the list.

**SIM card requirement**

1.  `MTS` or `Beeline`.
2.  The SIM card must be in your name.
3.  Tariff must support `Mobile payment`.
4.  Must have spent minumun 150 rubles for communication services.

<a name="percentage"></a>
## How to calculate percentage?

To calculate 5% of 600

`600 × 5% = 30`

To add 5% to 600

`600 + 5% = 630`

To subtract 5% from 600

`600 − 5% = 570`

The percent `[%]` button is available starting from version `3.0`.

<a name="decimal-places"></a>
## How to show more decimal places?

The app has rounding with automatic precision. You don't need to set it manually. For example:

2 decimal places

`1 BTC = 20790.02 USD`

5 decimal places

`1 JPY = 0.00778 USD`

7 decimal places

`1 USD = 0.0000481 BTC`

<a name="charts"></a>
## Why are there no charts?

I plan to add currency exchange rate charts to the app, but this requires significant modification to our server side.

So, the development of this feature may take some time.

<a name="hotkeys"></a>
## Hotkeys for keyboard

**Clear**  : `C` or `esc`

**Backspace** : `⌫` or `←`

**Swap** : `S` or `↑` or `↓`

**Copy** : `⌘ cmd` + `C`

**Paste** : `⌘ cmd` + `V`

**Plus** : `+`

**Minus** : `-`

**Multiply** : `X`

**Divide** : `/` or `\`

**Equal** : `⏎ ent`
